- 👋 Hi, I’m @oskeeker, a lead software engineer from Murcia :sunny: (Spain)
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, mostly focused in the BackEnd. I'm also a musician and a physics lover!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust! I want to develop a small idle game using Rust, lets see :sweat_smile:
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on science projects.
